# android-api-fetch
This sample demonstrates the api fetching, displays the list of items and displays
their detail on next fragment screen.

## what demonstrates
* MVVM architecture model
* DataBinding
* RecyclerView
* Retrofit with RxJava
* Dagger2
* ObservableFields
* Glide library for image loading
* Mockito for unit test cases

## Structure
- `app/` - Main application
- `app/test/` - Unit tests

## How to install/run this sample
This sample use the Gradle build system.
1. Open Android Studio and launch the Android SDK manager from it (Tools | Android | SDK Manager)
1. Ensure the following components are installed and updated to the latest version.
   1. *Android SDK Platform-Tools*
   1. *Android Support Repository*
   1. *Google Repository*

1. First download the samples by cloning this repository or downloading an archived snapshot. (See the options at the top of the page.)

1. In Android Studio, use the "Import non-Android Studio project" or "Import Project" option. Next select one of the sample directories that you downloaded from this repository.
If prompted for a gradle configuration accept the default settings.

To build the sample after you have applied the changes above, you can use the build/run option in Android Studio, or build directly from the command line if you prefer.

**IMPORTANT** Ensure you have set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable.

    cd /path/to/android-basic-samples
    export ANDROID_HOME = /path/to/android/sdk
    ./gradlew build

## Running Unit Tests
 In Android studio:
 - In the *Build Variants* window, make sure the *Local Unit Tests* option is selected.
 -   Check out the relevant code:
     * The application code is located in `src/main/java`
     * Unit Tests are in `src/test/java`
 - Open a unit/local test unit class like `MainActivityViewModelTest.java`.
 - Right click on the class and *Run* as JUnit test.

 From command-line via Gradle:
 - To run all the local unit tests in `app` execute:
 ```
 ./gradlew app:test
 ```

> OR

Create a test configuration with the JUnit4 runner: `org.junit.runners.JUnit4`

* Open *Run* menu | *Edit Configurations*

 * Add a new *JUnit* configuration

 * Choose module *app*

  * Select the class to run by using the *...* button

  * Run the newly created configuration

  _Note_: If all the unit tests have been successful you will get a BUILD SUCCESSFUL message.

## Code coverage

### Unit tests
In Android Studio, code coverage for **unit tests** (executed as JUnit tests) is shown in the editor, next to each line.
Run your tests using the *Run test with code coverage* option. Test reports can be generated changing the *Coverage runner* in the JUnit test configuration.

From the command-line via Gradle, unit tests for the module-plain-java are generated by executing:

```
./gradlew module-plain-java:test module-plain-java:TestReport
```

A HTML report will be available in `android-api-fetch/build/reports/test/html/index.html`

### See the report.
Test coverage reports for Android tests can be found in `app/build/reports/coverage`.
